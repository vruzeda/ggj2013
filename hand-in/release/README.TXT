========= INFO =========
Lindomar is a funny little creature, a top secret experiment that consists on giving life to a piece of jam by inputting it a heart. But something went wrong and Dr Cooper accidentally dropped Lindomar's vessel, giving it a chance to run for freedom! By increasing Lindomar's heartbeats, you can make it jump higher or let it rest to crouch so that it can evade obstacles as Dr. Cooper trys to catch it back.
